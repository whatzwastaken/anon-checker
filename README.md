# **ANON CHECKER**

![Project Banner](https://i.imgur.com/ecqgs6Y.png)  

A Python-based script for checking and analyzing Telegram number registrations. It fetches details from a website and checks if the numbers are registered on Telegram, displaying and saving the results. This project uses `aiohttp`, `pyrogram`, and other cool libraries to automate the process.

---

### **Features:**

- **Number Checking:** Fetches number data from a web source.
- **Telegram Registration Status:** Checks whether the numbers are registered on Telegram.
- **Price and Availability:** Displays the price and availability of each number.
- **Real-time Progress Bar:** Shows the progress with a nice **tqdm** bar.
- **Colored Output:** Displays results in color for easy reading and organization.
- **Results Export:** Saves the results into a `result.txt` file with registered and non-registered numbers.
- **Console Styling:** Styled output with `pyfiglet` and `pystyle`.

---

### **Libraries Used:**
- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP requests for fetching number data.
- `pyrogram`: Interacts with Telegramâ€™s API to check number registration.
- `beautifulsoup4`: Parses HTML to extract relevant number data.
- `tqdm`: A library for progress bars, making your command line more interactive.
- `pystyle`: Adds colors and styles to the terminal output for better visibility.
- `pyfiglet`: For ASCII art headers and text.
- `logging`: For logging important events and errors.

### **Setup & Installation:**

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anon-checker.git
   cd anon-checker
### 2. Install the required libraries:

You can install all the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a `nums.txt` file:

Create a `nums.txt` file with a list of numbers you want to check. The numbers must start with `+888` (e.g., `+888123456789`).

### 4. Fill in the API credentials:

- Go to [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org/auth) to get your `api_id` and `api_hash`.
- Set them in the script or create a `.env` file to securely store them.

### 5. Run the script:

```bash
python anon_checker.py
```
